Kraken Web Integrations are applications designed to interface with NZXT's [Kraken](https://nzxt.com/collection/kraken-z) line of CPU liquid coolers with a customizable LCD display on the pump block. [NZXT CAM](https://nzxt.com/software/cam) provides many modes and customization options, but web integrations brings customization to a new level.

## How does it work?

Kraken Web Integrations allow users to create custom displays and interactions for their Kraken liquid cooler using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These integrations utilize [NZXT CAM](https://nzxt.com/software/cam)'s data via the browser to communicate with the device and control its LCD display.

Users can create custom displays to show system performance data such as CPU usage, temperature, and fan speeds. They can also create custom animations, images, and text to display on the LCD screen.

Kraken Web Integrations can be created by anyone with web development skills and can be shared with the community on the Kraken Web Integrations website. Users can browse and download integrations that have been created by others, or create and upload their own.

## What are the benefits?

Kraken Web Integrations provide a high level of customization for users who want to personalize their Kraken liquid cooler display. This allows users to create unique displays that show the information they find most important or interesting.

Additionally, Kraken Web Integrations can help users monitor their system performance more easily. By displaying real-time data on the Kraken's LCD screen, users can keep an eye on their CPU usage, temperature, and fan speeds without having to open up a monitoring application.

Kraken Web Integrations foster a community of developers and users who can share their creations with each other. This creates a collaborative environment where users can learn from each other and create new and interesting displays for their Kraken liquid coolers.

## How do I use it?

To get started with Kraken Web Integrations, you will need to have a [supported](/docs/faq#supported-devices) NZXT cooler and NZXT CAM software installed on your system. The Web Integrations API is part of NZXT CAM in Web Integration Mode, so it is not required to install anything else to start using it.

You can find more information about how use Web Integration Mode on the [Installation](/docs/installation) page.
