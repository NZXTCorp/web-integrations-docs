Web Integrations are applications designed to interface with NZXT's [Kraken](https://nzxt.com/collection/kraken-z) line of CPU liquid coolers with LCD displays on the pump block. [NZXT CAM](https://nzxt.com/software/cam) offers a variety of modes and customization options, web integrations elevate the experience to a whole new level.

## How does it work?

When Web Integration Mode is enabled, CAM will render the specified URL in an internal web browser, and any content displayed in this browser will be shown on the NZXT Kraken's LCD screen.

Essential data for the web application, such as the device resolution or monitoring data is provided. This allows for the creation of new custom visuals using familiar web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## What are the benefits?

Web Integrations provide an unlimited level of customization. Users can create unique visuals that show the information they find most important or interesting.

Web Integrations can help users monitor their system performance more easily. By displaying real-time data on the NZXT Kraken's LCD screen, users can keep an eye on their CPU usage, temperature, and fan speeds without having to open up a monitoring application.

Our aim with Web Integrations is to let you in on the fun. We want to give you the tools to create your own unique displays and share them with the community. We are excited to see what you come up with!

## How do I use it?

To get started with Web Integrations, you will need to have a [supported](/docs/faq#supported-devices) NZXT cooler and NZXT CAM software installed on your system. Enable Web Integration Mode. Then you can start testing out your own Web Integrations under the custom option.
