Web Integrations are applications designed to interface with NZXT's [Kraken](https://nzxt.com/collection/kraken-z) line of CPU liquid coolers with LCD displays on the pump block. [NZXT CAM](https://nzxt.com/software/cam) offers a variety of modes and customization options, web integrations elevate the experience to a whole new level.

## How does it work?

When the Web Integration lighting mode is enabled for your NZXT Kraken device, NZXT CAM will stream the contents at the selected Web Integration's url to your NZXT Kraken device display.

We also allow for the creation of custom web integrations using familiar web technologies like HTML, Javascript, and CSS. If you would like to build your own custom web integration, you will have access to any data accessible from the internet, as well as NZXT CAM monitoring data data (e.g. device resolution or monitoring data).

## What are the benefits?

Web Integrations provide an unlimited level of customization. Users can create unique visualizations that show the information they find most important or interesting.

Web Integrations can help users monitor their system performance more easily. By displaying real-time data on the NZXT Kraken's LCD screen, users can keep an eye on their CPU usage, temperature, and fan speeds without having to open up a monitoring application.

Our aim with Web Integrations is to let you in on the fun. We want to give you the tools to create your own unique visualizations and share them with the community. We are excited to see what you come up with!

## How do I use it?

To get started with Web Integrations, you will need to have a [supported](/docs/faq#supported-devices) NZXT Kraken Series AIO liquid cooler and NZXT CAM software installed on your system. Enable Web Integration Mode. Then you can start testing out your own Web Integrations under the custom option.
